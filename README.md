Fork of CodePlex Hyper-V Monitor Gadget

With CodePlex shutting down I decided to take a copy of the very useful Hyper-V monitoring gadget originally created by Torre Levik (tore85) from https://hypervmonitor.codeplex.com/ and start a fork here on GitHub.

I have applied the patch that fixed it for Windows 2012-R2+ where Microsoft changed the WMI paths. This should work for 2008 and up at this point. 

There are some useful patches that _require_ 2012-R2, those have not yet been applied as I still have some 2008R2 servers. :-)

I welcome pull requests, contributions.
